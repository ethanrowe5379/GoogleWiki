    <section>
      <h2>Early Years</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <p>
            Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California.
            The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google
            Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[19][20] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow
            Garage in 2006.[21][22]
          </p>
          <p>
            While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[23] They called this algorithm
            PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[24][25] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's
            ideas.[19]
          </p>

            While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[23] They called this algorithm
            PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[24][25] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's
            ideas.[19]
          </p>
          <p>
            Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[26][27][28] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to
            the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor
            García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project.[29] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's
            PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.[30][31][32]
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word "googol",[33][34] the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to
            provide large quantities of information.[35]
          </p>
          <p>
            The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997,[37] and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of a friend (Susan Wojcicki[18]) in Menlo Park, California. Craig Silverstein, a fellow
            PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[18][38][39]
          </p>
          <p>
            Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated.[40] Google received money from three other angel investors
            in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, Stanford University computer science professor David Cheriton, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.[41] Between these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around 1 million dollars, which is
            what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California [42]
          </p>
          <p>
            After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[41] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[43] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia
            Capital.[40]

      <h2>Growth</h2>

      <p>TIn March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[44] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[45] The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords
        against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[46][18] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[47] In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the
        default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[48][49] </p>
      <p>
        In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.[51] The complex became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word
        googolplex, the number one followed by a googol zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[52] By that time, the name "Google" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb "google" to be
        added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, denoted as: "to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet".[53][54] Additionally, in 2001 Google's Investors felt the need to have
        a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the Chairman and CEO of Google [55]
      </p>

        <h2>Initial Public Offering</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <p>
              Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place five years later, on August 19, 2004. At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[56] At IPO, the company
              offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[57][58] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[59][60] The sale of $1.67 billion gave
              Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[61]
              In October 2006, Google announced that it had acquired the video-sharing site YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock,[62][63] and the deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[64][65] On April 13, 2007, Google reached an agreement to
              acquire DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies.[66]

              In 2005, The Washington Post reported on a 700 percent increase in third-quarter profit for Google, largely thanks to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[67]
              In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time.[68] By 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload, Google built 11 data centers
              around the world with some several thousand servers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever changing workload more efficiently.[55]
              On August 15, 2011, Google made its largest-ever acquisition to date when it announced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion[69][70] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent
              portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[71] mainly Apple and Microsoft,[72] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.[73]

      <h2>2012 onward</h2>

      <p>The year 2012 was the first time that Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, "We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36%
        year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half."[74]

        In June 2013, Google acquired Waze, a $966 million deal.[75] While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze and Google Maps,
        Google's own mapping service.[76]

        Google announced the launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple, Inc. chairman Arthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the "health and well-being" company would focus on
        "the challenge of ageing and associated diseases".[77]
      </p>
      <p>
        On January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire DeepMind Technologies, a privately held artificial intelligence company from London.[78] Technology news website Recode reported that the company was purchased for $400 million
        though it was not disclosed where the information came from. A Google spokesman would not comment of the price.[79][80] The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community.[81]
        According to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013,[82] 2014,[83] 2015,[84] and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.[85]
        On August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet. Google became Alphabet's leading subsidiary, and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests.
        Upon completion of the restructure, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.[86][87][88]
        As of October 2016, Google operates 70 offices in more than 40 countries.[89] Alexa, a company that monitors commercial web traffic, lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world.[14] Several other Google services also figure in
        the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube[90] and Blogger.[91]
        On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company which argued that "Google's ideological echo chamber" and bias clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also
        biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.[92] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore in violating company policy by "advancing harmful gender stereotypes
        in our workplace", and he was fired on the same day.[93][94][95] New York Times columnist David Brooks argued Pichai had mishandled the case, and called for his resignation.[96][97]
        On October 25, 2018, The New York Times published the exposé, "How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the ‘Father of Android’". The company subsequently announced that "48 employees have been fired over the last two years" for sexual
        misconduct.[98] On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints.[99][100]

        On March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud gaming platform called Google Stadia.[101]

        On June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for antitrust violations.[102]
