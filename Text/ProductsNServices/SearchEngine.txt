Google indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators.[103] According to comScore market research from November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%.[104] In May 2017, Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.[105][106]

Google launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites.[107] Google also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.[108]


Advertising

Google on ad-tech London, 2010
As per its 2017 Annual report, Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on google and YouTube, android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. 46% of this was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely AdMob, AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[109]

For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues.[110] In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.[111] In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from the company DoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.[112][113]

In 2007, Google launched "AdSense for Mobile", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.[114]

Google Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.[115] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[116] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.[117] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[118] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility.
