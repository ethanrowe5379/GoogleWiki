Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004. At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[57][58] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[61] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[166] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market.[167] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds.[167] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C shares and GOOGL class A shares.[168] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.[169]

The corporation's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[170] Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements.[171] By January 2014, Google's market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.[172]

Google uses various tax avoidance strategies. Out of the five largest American technology companies, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in for instance the UK is 28 per cent.[173] This has reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's transfer pricing practices.[174]

Google Vice-President Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[175] In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay Â£130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.[176] In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.[177]

In 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[178]
